 Overview

This project focuses on using image segmentation techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The goal of the project is to apply machine learning and image processing methods to accurately segment and highlight tumor regions within MRI images, facilitating better diagnosis and medical analysis.

The project employs deep learning methods to classify and segment images, and OpenCV for post-processing and visualization. The dataset consists of MRI scans labeled with tumor presence, allowing for both training and validation of the model.

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: MRI images are resized, normalized, and prepared for input into the neural network.
- Model Development: A deep learning model is trained to classify and segment tumor regions in the MRI scans.
- Mask Overlay: Tumor masks are generated and overlaid on the original MRI images to visualize the segmented tumor areas.
- Result Visualization: The project includes methods to display the segmented tumor regions on top of the MRI scans, highlighting the identified tumor area.

 Technology Stack
- TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the deep learning models.
- OpenCV: For image processing and visualization, including generating overlays of the segmented tumor masks.
- NumPy & Pandas: For handling data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the results and displaying segmented areas on the MRI images.
- Python: The primary programming language for the project.

 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - The MRI images are resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 128x128) and normalized for neural network input.
   - Labels indicating the presence of a tumor are processed to train the segmentation model.

2. Model Training:
   - A deep learning architecture is designed for image segmentation, trained on MRI images with tumor masks.
   - The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), and precision for segmentation tasks.

3. Post-processing and Mask Overlay:
   - The trained model generates binary masks for the test MRI images, identifying the regions corresponding to tumors.
   - Using OpenCV, the tumor mask is overlaid on the original MRI scan, highlighting the tumor with a red overlay for clear visualization.

4. Visualization:
   - The segmented results are displayed using Matplotlib, showing the original MRI images alongside the tumor detection overlay for easy interpretation.

 Results
- The model successfully detects and segments tumor regions in the MRI scans with high accuracy.
- Visual overlays of the segmented tumor regions provide clear, interpretable results for medical analysis.

 

 Future Work
- Improve segmentation accuracy by experimenting with advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net or Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs).
- Extend the model to work on different types of medical images beyond MRI.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for medical professionals to upload MRI scans and visualize tumor detection in real time.
