 Overview

This project involves building a regression model to predict the Body Mass Index (BMI) of individuals based on their height and weight. The dataset contains information about gender, height, and weight, along with a BMI index, which classifies individuals into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.

The goal of this project is to use linear regression to predict BMI from the given height and weight data and evaluate the model's performance.

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and categorical features like gender are converted to numerical values for model input.
- Model Development: A linear regression model is trained to predict BMI based on height and weight.
- Visualization: Plots are generated to visualize the relationship between height, weight, and BMI.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the regression model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

 Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Gender: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
- Height: Height of the individual in centimeters.
- Weight: Weight of the individual in kilograms.
- Index (BMI category): A numerical classification of BMI ranging from 0 (extremely underweight) to 4 (obese).

 Technology Stack
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing relationships between features and the BMI index.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing and evaluating the regression model.
- Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert categorical features (e.g., gender) to numerical values using label encoding.
   - Normalize and scale the height and weight features to ensure the regression model performs optimally.

2. Model Training:
   - Train a linear regression model to predict BMI based on height and weight.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalization ability.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using common metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Visualize the regression line and actual data points to assess the accuracy of predictions.

 Results
- Model Accuracy: The regression model provides a reasonable prediction of BMI based on the height and weight data.
- Error Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values are calculated to determine the model's performance.


 Future Work
- Experiment with advanced regression models, such as polynomial regression or decision trees, to improve prediction accuracy.
- Extend the model to include more features, such as age, to provide a more accurate BMI prediction.
- Implement a classification model to predict BMI categories directly instead of using a regression model.
