 Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The aim is to identify patterns in customer data that lead to churn and develop a predictive model that can help the company retain customers by implementing targeted interventions.

The project leverages a dataset that includes various customer features, such as contract details, services used, payment methods, tenure, and demographic information. By applying machine learning models, the goal is to classify customers who are at risk of leaving the company (churn) versus those likely to stay.

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data for effective model training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the relationship between features and churn through charts, and examines key statistical measures to understand the data distribution.
- Model Development: Uses logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks for churn prediction, with models evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Result Analysis: Provides a detailed analysis of model performance and suggests ways to improve customer retention by targeting factors that correlate strongly with churn.

 Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Customer Information: Gender, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents.
- Account Information: Tenure, Contract type, Payment method, Monthly and Total charges.
- Service Information: Phone service, Multiple lines, Internet service, Online security, Online backup, Device protection, Tech support, Streaming TV, Streaming movies.
- Target Variable: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).

 Technology Stack
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Python: Primary programming language used in the project.

 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., `customerID`).
   - Handle missing data in features like `TotalCharges`.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyze the distribution of churn among various categories (e.g., contract type, payment method).
   - Use correlation matrices and visualizations to identify relationships between features and churn.

3. Model Development:
   - Implement multiple machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks to predict churn.
   - Use grid search and cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
   
4. Evaluation:
   - Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
   - Select the best-performing model and interpret feature importance.

 Results
- Accuracy: Achieved a prediction accuracy of 91.71%.
- Outcome: The model can help the company identify customers who are likely to churn and focus retention strategies on these high-risk customers, potentially reducing customer churn by 15%.

 Future Work
- Experiment with additional machine learning algorithms like XGBoost or Random Forest.
- Implement a web-based dashboard to provide insights on customer churn in real-time.
- Improve model interpretability using SHAP or LIME to explain the predictions.
