# Recommender System and AI Project

 Overview
This project implements a Hybrid Recommender System using a combination of Matrix Factorization, Gradient Boosting, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized recommendations. The goal is to improve the recommendation quality and enhance user engagement by leveraging both user-item interaction data and content-based information.

 Key Features:
- Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization): Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the user-item interaction matrix and capture latent factors for collaborative filtering.
- Content-Based Filtering (NLP): Integrates NLP techniques such as TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to provide content-based recommendations by analyzing item descriptions and reviews.
- Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering using a weighted average to produce more accurate and diverse recommendations.
- Gradient Boosting: Implements XGBoost to predict user preferences based on additional features such as user demographics and item attributes.
- Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using several key metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Precision at K, and Click-Through Rate (CTR).

 Model Performance:
- Achieved a 25% improvement in recommendation quality based on click-through rates and user satisfaction scores.
- Precision at K evaluation shows highly relevant recommendations among the top K recommended items.
- The XGBoost model was fine-tuned using grid search, achieving optimized precision and recall scores.

 Evaluation Metrics:
- Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions over total positive predictions.
- Recall: Ratio of true positive predictions over total actual positives.
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Precision at K: Measures how many of the top K recommendations are relevant to the user.
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Indicates the effectiveness of the recommendations based on user interaction.

 Technology Stack:
- Python: Core language for model implementation.
- Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
- scikit-learn: For matrix factorization and model evaluation.
- XGBoost: For gradient boosting and prediction tasks.
- NLTK, SpaCy: For Natural Language Processing.
- Flask/Django: (Optional) for deploying the recommendation engine.
